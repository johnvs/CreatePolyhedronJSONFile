# Create Polyhedron JSON file

This is a Processing-based project which generates a JSON file that represents a polyhedron. The coordinate and vertex data sets are generated by the accompanying polyhedron classes.

* First, it generates the coordinates for the vertices of the polyhedron.

* Then it writes to a file those coordinates and groups of vertices that define the faces of the polyhedron.

VERY alpha. It works, though it needs a lot of restructuring.

The JSON output files are used by an accompanying project named Polyhedrons_3D.
